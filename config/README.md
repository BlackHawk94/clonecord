# Clonecord Configuration
Create a file named `config.json` or `config.{env}.json` where `{env}` is the NODE_ENV that you start Clonecord in.
`config.json` will be the exact same as `config.production.json`
Everything from `config.default.json` will be assigned to the config object that is created in `config/index.js`
